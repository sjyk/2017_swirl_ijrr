  Abstract                 = {Understanding human activities and object affordances are two very important skills,
 especially for personal robots which operate in human environments. In this work, we
 consider the problem of extracting a descriptive labeling of the sequence of
 sub-activities being performed by a human, and more importantly, of their interactions
 with the objects in the form of associated affordances. Given a RGB-D video, we jointly
 model the human activities and object affordances as a Markov random field where the nodes
 represent objects and sub-activities, and the edges represent the relationships between
 object affordances, their relations with sub-activities, and their evolution over time. We
 formulate the learning problem using a structural support vector machine (SSVM) approach,
 where labelings over various alternate temporal segmentations are considered as latent
 variables. We tested our method on a challenging dataset comprising 120 activity videos
 collected from 4 subjects, and obtained an accuracy of 79.4% for affordance, 63.4% for
 sub-activity and 75.0% for high-level activity labeling. We then demonstrate the use of
 such descriptive labeling in performing assistive tasks by a PR2 robot.},
